> We are not responsible for any personal files you may lose, or any hardware issues you may experience while using NeptuneOS. <br>

## üîç Prerequisites

- A USB (Optional)
- A backup of your personal files on another drive
- A general understanding of your system, and windows itself

## üíª Reinstalling Windows

You must reinstall windows to install NeptuneOS. This is to prevent unforseen issues in the OS. <br>
If you install NeptuneOS over an existing Windows install, especially one that's already optimized. You will experience issues. <br>
Your Windows ISO edition **must** be Pro or Enterprise.

<details><summary>Why Pro? üí¨</summary>
<br>
Home editions do not support a numerous amount of registry tweaks that are supported in Pro, such as those related to the Group Policy.
