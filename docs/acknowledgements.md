This documentation provides clarity on what open source repositories have been used in NeptuneOS.

## AtlasOS

My main inspiration for NeptuneOS began with AtlasOS. They have been a big standpoint for Neptune, and without them we wouldn't be here. <br>
The AtlasOS developers provide numerous convinient and ingenious ways to configure the operating system, such as he3als, with his online-sxs script. <br>
The main things we have sourced from Atlas, are their .cab packages. These packages allow for users to disable Windows Defender and Telemetry with ease, using the online-sxs script. This prevents a lot of issues when applying tweaks, as Defender likes to flag a lot of registry changes. <br>
Since the Defender Removal is done through a .cab package, this allows the user to install Neptune without having to touch defender. <br>
